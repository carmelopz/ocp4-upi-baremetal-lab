= Ingress Operator

Ingress Operator is an OpenShift component which enables external access to cluster services by configuring Ingress Controllers, which route traffic as specified by OpenShift Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources.

== Configuration

Modify the `+IngressController+` object to increase the number of replicas, allocate in infrastructure nodes or tune the configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
include::ingress-controller/default.yml[]
----

Create the object using the `+oc apply+` command on this file.

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f ingress-controller/default.yml
----

Wait until the new router is succesfully rolled out.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get deploy router-default -n openshift-ingress
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
router-default   3/3     3            3           98m
